# Flask Api
This is a simple Flask API to return the result of a classification model. I've generated about 13 features related to e-commerce's sellers behavior and the model's objective is churn prediction based on this 13 features. You'll find a jupyter notebook where i show the api call and a python script with the API itself. The API is hosted in my localhost by now, but i'll further learn how to provide it on cloud.<br><br>
PS: The model is a '.pkl' file generated by a Pycaret setup.
